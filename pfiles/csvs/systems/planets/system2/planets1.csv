20101,"M51-ULS-1b","M51-ULS-1b is the first candidate planet to be discovered outside of the Milky Way galaxy. It is located in the Whirlpool Galaxy, which is about 23 million light-years away from Earth. M51-ULS-1b is a circumbinary planet, meaning that it orbits two stars: a neutron star or black hole and a massive star.Based on the timing of the transits, astronomers estimate that M51-ULS-1b is about the same size as Saturn. It is also thought to be a gas giant planet. However, it is important to note that M51-ULS-1b has not yet been confirmed as a planet. More data is needed to rule out other possible explanations for the X-ray transits, such as a dust cloud or a smaller object."
20102,"OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb","OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb is a super-Earth planet that is located about 22,000 light-years from Earth in the galactic bulge. It was discovered in 2017 using the gravitational microlensing technique.OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb is thought to be about 13 times more massive than Earth and about 2.5 times larger. It is located in the habitable zone of its star, which means that it is possible that liquid water could exist on its surface. This makes OGLE-2016-BLG-1195Lb one of the most promising candidates for life outside of the solar system."
20103,"Kepler-186f","Kepler-186f is an Earth-sized exoplanet that is located about 500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. It was discovered in 2014 using the Kepler Space Telescope.Kepler-186f is the outermost of five planets that orbit the red dwarf star Kepler-186. It is thought to be about 1.17 times the mass of Earth and about 1.1 times the radius of Earth. It orbits its star at a distance of about 0.43 AU, which is slightly closer to its star than Mercury is to the Sun.Kepler-186f is located in the habitable zone of its star, which means that it is possible that liquid water could exist on its surface. This makes Kepler-186f one of the most promising candidates for life outside of the solar system."
20104,"KMT-2019-BLG-136Lb","KMT-2019-BLG-136Lb is a super-Earth exoplanet that was discovered in 2023 using the gravitational microlensing technique. It is located about 7,800 light-years from Earth in the galactic bulge.KMT-2019-BLG-136Lb is thought to be about 2.2 times more massive than Earth and about 1.8 times larger. It orbits its star at a distance of about 0.3 AU, which is slightly closer to its star than Venus is to the Sun.KMT-2019-BLG-136Lb is located in the habitable zone of its star, which means that it is possible that liquid water could exist on its surface. This makes KMT-2019-BLG-136Lb one of the most promising candidates for life outside of the solar system."
20105,"OGLE-2013-BLG-0765Lb","OGLE-2013-BLG-0765Lb is a super-Earth exoplanet that was discovered in 2013 using the gravitational microlensing technique. It is located about 25,000 light-years from Earth in the galactic bulge.OGLE-2013-BLG-0765Lb is thought to be about 4.6 times more massive than Earth and about 2.4 times larger. It orbits its star at a distance of about 0.8 AU, which is slightly closer to its star than Mars is to the Sun.If OGLE-2013-BLG-0765Lb is confirmed as habitable, it would be a major breakthrough in our search for life beyond Earth. It would show that super-Earth planets in the habitable zones of other stars are common. It would also give us a new target for future missions to search for signs of life."
20106,"KMT-2017-BLG-0208Lb","KMT-2017-BLG-0208Lb is a super-Earth exoplanet that was discovered in 2017 using the gravitational microlensing technique. It is located about 21,000 light-years from Earth in the galactic bulge.KMT-2017-BLG-0208Lb is thought to be about 3.4 times more massive than Earth and about 2.0 times larger. It orbits its star at a distance of about 1.7 AU, which is slightly closer to its star than Mars is to the Sun.KMT-2017-BLG-0208Lb is an exciting discovery, and it is one of the most promising candidates for life outside of the solar system. As our technology improves, we may be able to learn more about this planet and its potential for life."
