10301,"55 Cancri A","The primary star, 55 Cancri A, has a spectral type of K0IV-V, indicating a main-sequence or subgiant star. It is smaller in radius and slightly less massive than the Sun, and so is cooler and less luminous. The star has only low emission from its chromosphere, and is not variable in the visible spectrum;[15] but it is variable in X-rays.[26] It is more enriched than the Sun in elements heavier than helium, with 186% the solar abundance of iron; it is therefore classified as a rare ""super metal-rich"" (SMR) star.[15] 55 Cancri A also has more carbon than the Sun, with a C/O ratio of 0.78,[27] compared to solar value of 0.55. This abundance of metal makes estimating the star's age and mass difficult, as evolutionary models are less well defined for such stars.[citation needed] 55 Cancri A is much older than the solar system, and its age has been estimated to values of 7.4–8.7 billion years[28] or 10.2 ± 2.5 billion years."
10302,"55 Cancri B","The secondary, 55 Cancri B, is a red dwarf star much less massive and luminous than the Sun. There are indications that component B may itself be a double star, though this is uncertain."
10303,"55 Cancri e (anssen)","55 Cancri e (abbreviated 55 Cnc e, formally named Janssen /ˈdʒænsən/) is an exoplanet in the orbit of its Sun-like host star 55 Cancri A. The mass of the exoplanet is about 8.63 Earth masses and its diameter is about twice that of the Earth,[7] thus making it the first super-Earth discovered around a main sequence star, predating Gliese 876 d by a year. It takes fewer than 18 hours to complete an orbit and is the innermost-known planet in its planetary system. 55 Cancri e was discovered on 30 August 2004. However, until the 2010 observations and recalculations, this planet had been thought to take about 2.8 days to orbit the star.[5] In October 2012, it was announced that 55 Cancri e could be a carbon planet."
10304,"55 Cancri b (Galileo)","55 Cancri b (abbreviated 55 Cnc b), occasionally designated 55 Cancri Ab (to distinguish it from the star 55 Cancri B), also named Galileo, is an exoplanet orbiting the Sun-like star 55 Cancri A every 14.65 days. It is the second planet in order of distance from its star, and is an example of a hot Jupiter, or possibly rather ""warm Jupiter""."
10305,"55 Cancri c (Brahe)","55 Cancri c (abbreviated 55 Cnc c), formally named Brahe (pronounced /ˈbrɑːhiː/ or /ˈbrɑː/), is an extrasolar planet in an eccentric orbit around the Sun-like star 55 Cancri A, making one revolution every 44.34 days. It is the third known planet in order of distance from its star. 55 Cancri c was discovered on June 13, 2002, and has a mass roughly half of Saturn."
10304,"55 Cancri f (Harriot)","55 Cancri f (abbreviated 55 Cnc f), also designated Rho1 Cancri f and formally named Harriot /ˈhæriət/,[2] is an exoplanet approximately 41 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Cancer (the Crab). 55 Cancri f is the fourth known planet (in order of distance) from the star 55 Cancri and the first planet to have been given the designation of ""f""."
10304,"55 Cancri d (Lipperhey)","55 Cancri d (abbreviated 55 Cnc d), formally named Lipperhey /ˈlɪpərhiː/, is an extrasolar planet in a long-period orbit around the Sun-like star 55 Cancri A. Located at a similar distance from its star as Jupiter is from the Sun, it is the fifth and outermost known planet in its planetary system. 55 Cancri d was discovered on June 13, 2002."
