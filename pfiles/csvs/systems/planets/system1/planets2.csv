10201,"Gliese 581e","Gliese 581e is the innermost planet and, with a minimum mass of 1.7 Earth masses, is the least massive of the three. Discovered in 2009, it is also the most recent confirmed planet to have been discovered in this system. It takes 3.15 days to complete an orbit. Initial analyses suggested that the planet's orbit is quite elliptical but after correcting the radial velocity measurements for stellar activity, the data now indicate a circular orbit."
10202,"Gliese 581b","Gliese 581b is the most massive planet known to be orbiting Gliese 581 and was the first to be discovered."
10203,"Gliese 581c","Gliese 581c is the third planet orbiting Gliese 581. In their 2007 paper, Udry et al. asserted that if Gliese 581c has an Earth-type composition, it would have a radius of 1.5RðŸœ¨, which would have made it at the time ""the most Earth-like of all known exoplanets"".A direct measurement of the radius cannot be taken because, viewed from Earth, the planet does not transit its star. The minimum mass of the planet is 5.5 times that of Earth. The planet initially attracted attention as being potentially habitable, though this has since been discounted. The mean blackbody surface temperature has been estimated to lie between âˆ’3 Â°C (for a Venus-like albedo) and 40 Â°C (for an Earth-like albedo), however, the temperatures could be much higher (about 500 degrees Celsius) due to a runaway greenhouse effect akin to that of Venus."
10104,"Gliese 581d","Gliese 581g, unofficially known as Zarmina's World, was a candidate exoplanet claimed to orbit Gliese 581, but its existence was ultimately refuted. It was thought to orbit with a period of 36.6 days at a distance of 0.146 AU, placing it within the habitable zone, and to have a minimum mass of 3.1 M."
10205,"Gliese 581g","Gliese 581d was a candidate exoplanet thought to orbit Gliese 581, which was at one point heavily disputed, and has been found by a number of studies to be a false positive originating from stellar activity. The planet's minimum mass was thought to be 6.98 M and its radius, assuming an Earth-like composition, was estimated to be 2.2 RðŸœ¨, making it a super-Earth. Its orbital period was thought to be 66.87 days long, with a semi-major axis of 0.21847 AU, with an unconstrained eccentricity. Analysis suggested that it orbits within the star's habitable zone, where the temperatures are just right to support life."
10206,"Gliese 581f","Gliese 581f was a candidate exoplanet claimed to orbit Gliese 581, but its existence was ultimately refuted. It was thought to orbit with a period of 433 days at a distance of 0.758 AU, and to have a minimum mass of 7.0 M"
